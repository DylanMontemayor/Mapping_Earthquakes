# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview of the Module 13 Challenge

Through this project, we created an interactive map with d3, Mapbox, and leaflet libraries. This visualization will allow the user to see the earthquakes that have happened in the last 7 days and their location and magnitude. The user will be able to choose between three map styles and the option to see all the earthquakes, the tectonic places, and the Major earthquakes (4 and higher).

### Folders/Files

Earthquake_Challenge: 
1. index.html
2. Static: CSS (style.css), js (challenge_logic.js)

## Results

The first style that will show when opening the HTML file is the streets one and it will show the three layers before: all earthquakes, tectonic plates, and major earthquakes.

### Satellite and all earthquakes

In this map, we chose the satellite map style and we kept all the layers. The magnitude and location can be seen after clicking on any earthquake circle marker.

### Tectonic plates and major earthquakes

In this map, we chose the dark mode map style and we kept only the tectonic plates and the major earthquakes. It is still possible to click over the circle marker and see the earthquake magnitude and location.

## Summary

In this project, we used javascript open source libraries, js, and HTML to create an interactive map. With these tools is possible to make it more interactive or to add more specific data regarding each earthquake.
